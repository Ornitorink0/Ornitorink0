# üí´ About Me

üëã Hi, I'm <b>Ornitorink0</b>!

‚ú® I'm a computer science student at **IS Sobrero**, passionate about **programming**, **design** and **art**. I started exploring the world of computers when I was a child and this curiosity has always pushed me to learn more. I like both working on the **front-end**, where I can express my creativity, **back-end** and exploring **low-level** programming, which allows me to understand how systems really work. I like to adapt to different challenges, always trying to improve.

üé® **Web design** is my main creative outlet, and I always try to create projects that are not only functional, but also aesthetically pleasing. In my free time I like to dedicate myself to different passions: producing **music**, **writing**, **photography**, working out at the **gym** and much more. Each hobby helps me develop new skills and express my creative side.

üòÑ I'm a **proactive** person and always ready for new challenges. I like to listen to other people's advice and **collaborate**, because I believe that discussion is essential to **grow**. I have clear goals and I will do my best to achieve them.

‚öíÔ∏è I am currently focused on **studying** and on some personal and extracurricular **projects**. My goal is to finish school with excellent grades and continue my studies in **engineering** at university.

When I work on projects, the frameworks and tools I choose really make a difference. I love using **Vite** for fast and optimized development; its ability to offer a lean and responsive development environment is unmatched. For the <span class="keyword">front-end</span>, **React** is my go-to: its flexibility and large community support make it perfect for creating dynamic and modern interfaces. I also love **Electron** when developing desktop applications: it allows me to leverage my web knowledge to create powerful cross-platform solutions. Additionally, I like to integrate all of this with **Chakra UI**, a system of components that allows me to quickly design elegant and responsive interfaces, without having to sacrifice customization. These tools, working together, allow me to create scalable and well-crafted projects.

For the <span class="keyword">back-end</span>, I admit that I am still in the learning phase, but I am making progress. Currently, I use tools like **Netlify** and **Railway** to publish my projects, taking advantage of their simplicity and fast integration with the front-end. Netlify is especially useful for deploying static applications, while Railway gives me the ability to efficiently run full-stack applications, supporting both servers and databases. While I still have a lot to learn in the backend world, these tools are allowing me to experiment and grow on a practical level.
