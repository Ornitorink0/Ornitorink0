## About me

✨ I'm a **computer science student**, passionate about **programming**, **design** and **art**. I started exploring the world of computers when I was a child and this curiosity has always pushed me to learn more. I enjoy working... basically on everything, actually. Mainly on the front end, where I can express my creativity, and on the back end, as well as exploring low-level programming, which allows me to understand how systems actually work. I enjoy adapting to different challenges, always striving to improve.

😄 I'm a proactive person, always ready to take on new challenges. I enjoy listening to others' advice and collaborating, because I believe that discussion is essential for growth. I tend to take on a leadership role in teams because I love squeezing people's input and thinking through problems thoroughly. Furthermore, I have clear goals and will do my best to achieve them.

⚒️ I am currently focused on studying and on some personal and extracurricular projects. My goal is to finish school with excellent grades and continue my studies in **computer engineering** at PoliTO (Polytechnic University of Turin).

🤖 I often use AI for programming, but I'm still practicing my problem-solving skills. Programming is just a task; you have to think quickly and effectively, right? I like to keep my repositories clean, efficient, easy to understand, well-documented, and formatted. I use it mainly to avoid rookie mistakes, so I write my version first, then the AI ​​analyzes it and suggests changes. 🦾

### 🧭 Philosophy
- Control > magic
- Fast and hackable tooling
- Less framework, more foundation
- Engineer mindset

I like to do so many things, it's hard for me to focus on just one thing...

> P.S. 🙃 Forgive me if my English is strange, especially in the documentation. I'm better at writing English than I am at speaking it.
